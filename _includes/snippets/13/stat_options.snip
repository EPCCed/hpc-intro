* `-l select=<nnodes>:ncpus=<ncores per node>` - how many nodes does your job need and how
  many cores per node? Note that there are 36 cores per node on Cirrus.

* `-l walltime=<hours:minutes:seconds>` - How much real-world time (walltime) will your job take to
  run?

* `-l place=scatter:excl` - Reserve your nodes just for yourself. (If you are using full nodes,
  you should include this as it stops other users from interfering with the performance of your
  job.)
