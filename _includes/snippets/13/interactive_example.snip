{{site.sched_submit}} (with the right options) can submit a job and then wait for it to start
so we can use the compute node resources interactively. Letâ€™s demonstrate
this by submitting an interactive job that uses a single node:

```
{{ site.host_prompt }} {{site.sched_submit}} {{ site.sched_submitiopt }}
```

You should be presented with a bash prompt. Note that the prompt will likely
change to reflect your new location, in this case the worker node we are logged
on. You can also verify this with `hostname`.

When you are done with the interactive job, type exit to quit your session.
