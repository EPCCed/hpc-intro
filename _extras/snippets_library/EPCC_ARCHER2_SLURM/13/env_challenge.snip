> ## Job environment variables
>
> When SLURM runs a job, it sets a number of environment variables for the job. One of these will
> let us check our work from the last problem. The `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` variable is set to the
> number of CPUs we requested with `-c`. Using the `SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` variable, modify your job
> so that it prints how many CPUs have been allocated.
